# Polygon Edge simple deployment on AWS

## Prerequisites

Three variables that must be provided, before running the deployment:

* `account_id` - the AWS account ID that the Polygon Edge blockchain cluster will be deployed on.
* `alb_ssl_certificate` - the ARN of the certificate from AWS Certificate Manager to be used by ALB for https protocol.   
  The certificate must be generated before starting the deployment, and it must have **Issued** status.
* `premine` - the account/s that will receive pre mined native currency.
  Value must follow the official [CLI](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/edge/get-started/cli-commands#genesis-flags) flag specification.

## Deployment
To get Polygon Edge cluster quickly up and running default values:
* include this module 
* define mandatory variables or provide them at cli prompt    
* `terraform init` - to initialize modules   
* `terraform apply` - to deploy the infrastructure

After everything is deployed the JSON-RPC URL should be outputted in the CLI, which needs to be set as a CNAME target 
for a domain that you've created the certificate for.
